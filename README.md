# JavaScript Exercises

I wanted to collect some JavaScript exercises and my solutions for them in one place, instead of having them scattered across various repl.its and elsewhere on my computer. So I decided to put them in a single repository. These exercises are taken from the assignments given to me in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Remote Flex program, in which I am currently a student.
